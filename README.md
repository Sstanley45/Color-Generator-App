# Color Generating App

This is a brief README for the Color Generating App project.

# How It's Made

The Color Generating App is developed using HTML, CSS, and ReactJS. It provides a simple and intuitive interface for generating and exploring colors.

The app utilizes HTML for the structure of the web page and CSS for styling and visual enhancements. ReactJS, a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces, is employed to create dynamic and interactive components.

To access a wide range of colors, the app integrates an external JavaScript library called values.js. This library provides functionality to generate different shades, tints, and variations of colors, allowing users to explore a diverse color palette.
